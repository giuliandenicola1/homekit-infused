## Homekit Infused (Lovelace) by Jimz011 April 2021 v3.6.1 (*updated: 03/04/2021)
*Note: You MUST have a working Home Assistant install to use this project, you can download Home Assistant [here](https://home-assistant.io).
*Latest compatible Home Assistant version is 2021.3.4 (do not update past this number for best compatibility)

### About
Homekit Infused is a project for Home Assistant that consists out of two major components, the framework and the addons. The framework can be run standalone and will not require any of the addons to be installed. This is useful for people that just want the header/footer and the menu that is present in HKI. To get the most out of this project it is recommended that you have at least the very basic knowledge of how Home Assistant and Lovelace works.

*Note: None of the custom-cards used in this project are made by me and every custom-card used has a reference to their original creators as well as the original link to their repo's. All contributors/donators and people that gave me the inspiration are mentioned in the docs on the last page!

### Featured Theme
Dwains Theme is a beautiful theme created by @Dwains which can be found [here](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme). I will recommend this theme as an alternative to HKI when you are using lighter hardware.
